# Grid-Forming
This exercise is mainly learning how to print out a grid. 
Essentially im learning how to properly format patters and grids to help with embedding.
Can be used for design or for future use in the bot.
# UPDATED VERSION
I found a way to simplify the entire code in 3 lines total.
run on python 3.6.5
